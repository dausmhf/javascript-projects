# JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my JavaScript learning progress, exercises, and mini projects as I work toward becoming a **Fullstack JavaScript Developer**.

## Goals
- Build strong JavaScript fundamentals
- Practice problem solving and clean code
- Create mini projects to apply what I learn
- Move from basics → DOM → async → Node.js → fullstack

## Progress Tracker
- [ ] JavaScript basics (variables, data types, operators)
- [ ] Conditions (if/else, switch)
- [ ] Arrays and objects
- [ ] Functions and scope
- [ ] DOM manipulation
- [ ] Async JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- [ ] Node.js + Express
- [ ] Databases (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Fullstack project (frontend + backend)


## Mini Projects
- Calculator (coming soon)
- Todo App (coming soon)
- Weather App (coming soon)

## Notes
This repository is for learning and practice.  
Each commit represents progress and improvements in my coding skills.
